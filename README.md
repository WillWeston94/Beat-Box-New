# Beat-Box-New

The following set of folders show a TDD of a Linked List utilizing a node class, a LinkedList and a BeatBox class to play some silly things with sound. Specifically, a very basic drum machine program.

This program follows a LinkedList which is connected by a series of Nodes where each Node is a data structure holding a "beat"

Each Node in the series has a pointer that points to the next Node in the list if applicable.
IE first node points to second node, second node points to third node that contain our data. After all nodes have been traversed a nil or null address will be pointed to as it signifies the end of the linkedlist.
